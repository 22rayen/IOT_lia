Brainstorming ideas: 

Light chase lane, light range depending on the strength of the outside light 

straight 

"A heater" depending on the temperature 

-------------------------------------------------

 

 

 

We chose to creat3 an LED circuit in which the intensity will be controlled by the strength of the outside ambient light. 

 
The LEDs will have a chase function (extra)


The LEDs will be lit at different intensities depending on that of the light. 
 

Materials: 


LEDs 
Esp32 
Power source 
Resistors 
3D circuit printed 
Raspberry Pi

We uploaded the schematic on another file of how the project is going to function.

We have not managed to show 50% of our project implementation, not even close to doing so. 

We have a bit of our code, but the hardware is not yet ready and not done for demonstration..
