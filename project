Brainstorming ideas: 

Light chase lane, light range depending on the strength of the outside light 

straight 

"A heater" depending on the temperature 

 

 

 

 

Creating a LED circuit in which the intensity will be controlled by the strength of the outside light. 

 

The LEDs will have a chase function (extra) 

 

The LEDs will be lit at different intensities depending on that of the light.
